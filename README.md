# Animal rescue website

## Overview

- _Fork this repository._
- Completely re-design an animal rescue website that you find online that’s not currently designed very well.
  <br>Here are some examples of rescues whose websites could use an update:
  - [Birch Haven](http://www.birchhaven.org/)
  - [Loyal Rescue](http://www.loyalrescue.com/)
  - [Freedom Dog Rescue](http://www.freedomdogrescue.ca/)
  - [BARK Ottawa](http://www.bark-ottawa.com/)
  - [Adirondack Save Stray](https://www.adirondacksaveastray.org/)
- Create a 3-page website: Home, List of Available Rescues & Adopt a Rescue
- _It should have real text content_—**that you have written yourself.**
- It should be completely designed, with real images, real colours—and it should look amazing.
- **Don’t steal images**—use properly licensed images. If the image requires that you credit the author use a [`humans.txt`](https://learntheweb.courses/topics/search-engine-optimization/#humanstxt) file. ([See an example `humans.txt` file](https://github.com/acgd-webdev-3/modularity-mindfulness/blob/gh-pages/humans.txt)).
- Don’t start writing code without first doing everything as expected in your IxD class: target audience analysis, website goals, competitive analysis, sitemap, wireframes, etc.
- _The website should obviously be fully responsive: working on screensizes from `320px` all the way to `~2500px`._
- _Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks._

---

## Details

We are only concentrating on making these 3 pages—**but the navigation should absolutely suggest the rest of the pages exist on the website.**

### `index.html` — Homepage

The homepage of the rescue website should accomplish the goals for the target audience you’ve researched when doing your UX.

- Consider the goals of the website.
- Consider the responsiveness.
- Consider your performance budget.
- Consider accessibility concerns.

### `rescues.html` — List of Available Rescues

The Rescues page is the page that lists all the available animals, giving details about each animal and photos of what they look like.

- You don’t need to go overboard listing an excessive number of animals, just show ~5 examples, giving the idea of what the completed page would look like.
- Consider the responsiveness.
- Consider your performance budget.
- Consider accessibility concerns.

### `adopt.html` — Adopt a Rescue

The Adopt page is the _huge_ form that users fill out to adopt a rescue animal. Look at some examples like [Loyal Rescue](http://loyalrescue.com/application.php).

- You don’t have to do every single form field, but it should be a significant enough amount to represent what the form would look like upon completion.
- Consider the responsiveness.
- Consider your performance budget.
- Consider accessibility concerns.

## Deliverables

There are a few different things that will be checked throughout the process:

1. [Animal rescue website UX](https://learntheweb.courses/courses/web-dev-3/week-13/#animal-rescue-website-ux)
   <br>— **Due week 13**
   <br>(checked for completion, graded with final website)
2. [Animal rescue website check-in](https://learntheweb.courses/courses/web-dev-3/week-14/#animal-rescue-website-check-in)
   <br>— **Due week 14**
   <br>(checked for completion)
3. [Request for grade](https://learntheweb.courses/courses/web-dev-3/week-15/#request-for-grade)
   <br>— **Due week 15**
4. [Final animal rescue website redesign](https://learntheweb.courses/courses/web-dev-3/week-15/#animal-rescue-website)
   <br>— **Due week 15**

## Teacher’s expectations

This website is to prove that you—by yourself—can do everything we covered in class. Look back over all the assignments from the term, determine what kernel of knowledge they were trying to teach you, and see if you can implement it in this website.

There should be a significant example of everything we’ve learned this term in this website. **Leave the impression that you’ve confident with what we’ve learned and can apply everything.**

## Markbot’s expectations

Markbot has a bunch of expectations on the code of your website. _But luckily for you **no** screenshot checking._

### General expectations

- Proper naming conventions are followed
- Minimum 10 commits that follow best practices

### All HTML files

Name the HTML files: `index.html`, `rescues.html` & `adopt.html`

- `header`, `header nav`, `header nav li`, `header nav a`, `main`, `section` or `article`
- `modules.css`, `grid.css`, `type.css`, `main.css`
  And many of the expected classes: `.grid`, `.unit`, `.xs-`, `.s-`, `.m-`, `.l-`, `.pad-`, `.push`, `.gutter`, `.list-group`, _font size classes_
  _Remember to choose only the modules that are necessary_
- A `color` or `background-color` hover state on the navigation
- A unique `<title>` & `<h1>` for everything HTML page
- Proper focus states for navigation and main content links
- Fits within the [standard performance budget](https://learntheweb.courses/topics/performance-checklist/)
- Passes all [accessibility checks](https://learntheweb.courses/topics/accessibility-checklist/) including skip links and ARIA landmark roles
- _Google Fonts are optional—you may decided they have too much of a performance impact._

### CSS files

- CSS requirements are really open—just make sure the CSS is valid & indented properly.

### Images

- All images should be smushed, with a maximum file size of `250kB` and maximum dimensions of `2500px`
- Proper favicons, `favicon.ico` & `favicon-196.png`

## Browser & accessibility testing

In class, week 15, we will be doing lots of peer testing—most of the website needs to be complete by then.

Each person will be assigned a tool and will be required to test everybody’s websites.

- [Accessibility testing](https://learntheweb.courses/courses/web-dev-2/accessibility-testing/)
- [Browser testing](https://learntheweb.courses/courses/web-dev-1/browser-testing/)

## Hand in

Drop this folder into your Markbot application. Make sure to fix all the errors. And submit for grades using Markbot.

**When you submit to Progressinator, you’ll see a grey checkmark that shows the project was handed in.** You’ll still have to write a _Request for Grade_ and the teacher will still be grading it personally.
